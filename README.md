üè¶ Banking Dashboard ‚Äì Customer Insights & Performance
üìå Overview

The Banking Dashboard is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to analyze and visualize banking operations. Using Python (EDA in Jupyter Notebook), SQL, Power BI, and Advanced Excel, it transforms raw customer and transaction data into actionable business insights.

The dashboard focuses on customer demographics, account balances, loan performance, credit card usage, and revenue insights to support better decision-making.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Python (Jupyter Notebook) ‚Äì Data preprocessing, cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

SQL ‚Äì Querying structured data, aggregating insights, and handling large datasets.

Power BI ‚Äì Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

Advanced Excel ‚Äì Pivot tables, charts, and advanced formulas for quick analytics.

üîë Features

Customer Demographics ‚Äì Analysis by age, gender, and income levels.

Account Insights ‚Äì Balances, deposits, withdrawals, and savings trends.

Loan Portfolio ‚Äì Loan types, average loan size, repayment delays, and NPA (non-performing assets).

Credit Card Usage ‚Äì Spending categories, outstanding balances, and repayment behavior.

Revenue & Profitability ‚Äì Interest income, fee income, and net profitability.

Churn Prediction ‚Äì Identifying at-risk customers using behavioral indicators.

üêç Sample Python EDA (Jupyter Notebook)
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("bank_customers.csv")

# Basic Info
print(df.head())
print(df.info())

# Missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Distribution of customer ages
sns.histplot(df['Age'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title("Customer Age Distribution")
plt.show()

# Loan amount vs. income
sns.scatterplot(x='EstimatedIncome', y='LoanAmount', data=df)
plt.title("Loan Amount vs Income")
plt.show()

# Average credit card balance by occupation
avg_balance = df.groupby('Occupation')['CreditCardBalance'].mean()
print(avg_balance)

üóÑÔ∏è Sample SQL Queries
-- 1. Average balance of customers by income band
SELECT IncomeBand, AVG(AccountBalance) AS Avg_Balance
FROM Customers
GROUP BY IncomeBand;

-- 2. Total loan amount disbursed by loan type
SELECT LoanType, SUM(LoanAmount) AS TotalLoanDisbursed
FROM Loans
GROUP BY LoanType;

-- 3. Top 5 cities by total deposits
SELECT City, SUM(DepositAmount) AS TotalDeposits
FROM Accounts
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY TotalDeposits DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 4. Average credit card balance by age group
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN Age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 25 AND 40 THEN '25-40'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN '41-60'
    ELSE '60+'
  END AS AgeGroup,
  AVG(CreditCardBalance) AS AvgBalance
FROM Customers
GROUP BY AgeGroup;

-- 5. Customer churn (inactive for 6+ months)
SELECT CustomerID, LastTransactionDate
FROM Transactions
WHERE LastTransactionDate < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

üìä Business Impact

Identify profitable customer segments for targeted marketing.

Optimize loan and credit card strategies by analyzing repayment patterns.

Monitor branch-wise deposits & loans for regional insights.

Reduce customer churn by flagging inactive accounts early.

üöÄ How to Use

Run Python EDA Notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.

Load the processed dataset into SQL for advanced queries.

Connect SQL / dataset to Power BI for dashboard building.

Use Advanced Excel for pivot tables and ad-hoc reports.

Explore the dashboard interactively (filter by customer type, loan type, region, etc.).
